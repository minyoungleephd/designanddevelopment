<b>Theoretical Foundations of ELT</b> </p></d>

<d><p>  First, when I was reading through Gartner’s Hype-cycle articles and readings (Dedehavir & Steinert, 2016), as it was my first time learning about this concept, I found it interesting to apply this with an emerging learning technology perspective. After going through our group activity in terms of learning about previous emerging technology and how it has developed over time or how it has been deteriorating over time due to certain factors. One of the factors that caught my attention that may prevent a technology to diminish or become “unpopular” would be the cost or certain features that may be incompatible or not feasible with other devices. For example, in South Korea, before I started using Apple iPhones as my mobile device, I used Motorola flip phones or Android phones in the past. When the product advertisements come out, everyone around me including my relatives and peers would pay attention on getting a new Motorola or Android device which can be in the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ stage which happens in a lot of new products in the beginning, and I have noticed this in my own experience. However, for me personally, the Motorola flip phones did not last long than I have expected as I saw new devices coming out that had more smart phone features which are elegant looking with advanced features. I enjoy taking pictures and the new phones that come out would have better photo or video quality for the viewers/consumers. It depends on the product features, the whole environment that the product is being released and the target audience and many more other factors that will explain and determine each stage of the Hype Cycle.

Second, one of the technologies that I’d like to focus on would be virtual reality technology (VR). There are many studies out there that talks about how VR can assist student learning in a variety of ways and methods. One of the main theoretical concepts in VR is the 3Is that Liu et al. (2013) mentions which is in the following: immersion, interaction, and imagination. Students will be able to use VR technology to immerse themselves in a simulated controlled environment and the environment itself can make them feel as if they are personally in the scene to stay engaged and interact with one another. The sensual stimuli and responses in a VR environment can help students interact more and they can use their imagination in creating a VR environment themselves which can boost their creative thinking in a learning environment.

Third, also in this article, it uses virtual reality technology to promote creative thinking amongst student learning and it has used a quasi-experimental research approach when it comes to the study methodology. The study focused on creating thinking instruction using VR technology and the theory the authors mentioned was called, the stimulus-response learning theory (Clifton & Mann, 2010) in behaviorism meaning that all human activities are being responded to stimuli. The authors wanted to give the students proper stimuli in the VR environment to generate their responses to accumulate a positive learning experience. The following were the proposed hypotheses:
<ol>
<li>>H1: Creative Thinking Instruction presents notable effects on sensitivity.</li>
<li>H2: Creative Thinking Instruction reveals remarkable effects on fluency.</li>
<li>H3: Creative Thinking Instruction shows the optimal effect on promoting sensitivity in virtual reality.</li>
<li>H4: Creative Thinking Instruction appears the optimal effect on promoting fluency in virtual reality.</li>
</ol>
</p></d>
<d><p>
There were 104 students involved in data collection in a national university for 16 weeks total and the researchers used analysis of variance when it comes data analysis approach for this study. The study results showed that the application of VR to education has its potential as students were able to freely express and observe and control the objects within the VR environment which helped them promote their creative thinking and active learning mindset. When it comes to limitations in this study, the authors suggested that there needs to be a lot of training in terms of using VR technology both for the instructors and the students to fully engage and familiarize themselves using this specific technology within the classroom.
