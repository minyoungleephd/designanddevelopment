	<b>My ELT Vision (Before Class)</b></p></div>

<div><p>When it comes to my professional career I have always thought of myself as a “designer”. I am still not sure what kind of designer specifically I would like to become, however, I knew deep down inside, I always knew that I had a “designer eye”. I like to create things for people and design and stay creative and innovative. </p></div> 
<div><p>I started my professional journey starting when I was in my undergraduate years at the University of Minnesota with a major in Communication with a journalism minor working as a teaching assistant. I remember mentoring and helping my peers as a TA with their exams and homework assignments and alleviate the burden of my course professor. With my journalism minor background I have always wanted to create content and I really enjoyed making videos and taking pictures for my student projects. With my video and photography skills, I slowly developed a design and creative identity as a person and a college student professional. As I wanted to further study in Communication, I had the opportunity to continue my higher education journey pursing my masters at the University of Central Florida. For 2 years, I was teaching undergraduate students, in-person and also online using Canvas, public speaking. Through my teaching experience, I was able to develop my professional skills in public speaking and large audience presentations. Also, I got more interested in creating online courses or designing online courses while using Canvas which led me to pursue another master’s degree in Instructional Design. This was a huge turning point in my career as I was determined to get a job in a broadcasting company with my communication and journalism background, however, as I grew my interest in online course teaching, I decided to continue my journey in instructional design and building and creating online courses for different types of audiences. As soon as I pursued two master’s degrees in communication and Instructional Design, I took a gap year and worked as an instructional design intern, curriculum designer, and technical writer in an industry setting and also in universities. With these valuable experiences, I wanted to study more in instructional design which led me to pursue my PhD in Educational Technology at the University of Florida. I was not aware of a lot of the advanced learning technologies such as VR and AI technology until I got into program. As my advisor, Dr. Matthew Martin Schmidt, is a VR expert, I was able to be exposed to a lot of VR research projects which made me more interested in the technology and it ended up being my passion and main research/career interest. </p></div>
<div><p>Currently, I vision myself designing and developing products or software programs or projects using VR or other advanced learning technologies after I graduate with my doctoral degree. I would also like to continue teaching on emerging learning technologies and educational technologies in general and introducing college students on how they can utilize technology in their own instructional context. I consider myself a technology geek and I am passionate about immersive technology and how it can assist with people’s mental well-being as that is also one of my main research interests. I hope to gain more knowledge the next two years during my PhD to continue solidifying my career path that includes ELT. </p></div>
