	<b>My ELT Vision (Before Class)</b></p></div>

<div><p>When it comes to my professional career I have always thought of myself as a “designer”. I am still not sure what kind of designer specifically I would like to become, however, I knew deep down inside, I always knew that I had a “designer eye”. I like to create things for people and design and stay creative and innovative. </p></div> 
<div><p>I started my professional journey starting when I was in my undergraduate years at the University of Minnesota with a major in Communication with a journalism minor working as a teaching assistant. I remember mentoring and helping my peers as a TA with their exams and homework assignments and alleviate the burden of my course professor. With my journalism minor background I have always wanted to create content and I really enjoyed making videos and taking pictures for my student projects. With my video and photography skills, I slowly developed a design and creative identity as a person and a college student professional. As I wanted to further study in Communication, I had the opportunity to continue my higher education journey pursing my masters at the University of Central Florida. For 2 years, I was teaching undergraduate students, in-person and also online using Canvas, public speaking. Through my teaching experience, I was able to develop my professional skills in public speaking and large audience presentations. Also, I got more interested in creating online courses or designing online courses while using Canvas which led me to pursue another master’s degree in Instructional Design. This was a huge turning point in my career as I was determined to get a job in a broadcasting company with my communication and journalism background, however, as I grew my interest in online course teaching, I decided to continue my journey in instructional design and building and creating online courses for different types of audiences. As soon as I pursued two master’s degrees in communication and Instructional Design, I took a gap year and worked as an instructional design intern, curriculum designer, and technical writer in an industry setting and also in universities. With these valuable experiences, I wanted to study more in instructional design which led me to pursue my PhD in Educational Technology at the University of Florida. I was not aware of a lot of the advanced learning technologies such as VR and AI technology until I got into program. As my advisor, Dr. Matthew Martin Schmidt, is a VR expert, I was able to be exposed to a lot of VR research projects which made me more interested in the technology and it ended up being my passion and main research/career interest. </p></div>
<div><p>Currently, I vision myself designing and developing products or software programs or projects using VR or other advanced learning technologies after I graduate with my doctoral degree. I would also like to continue teaching on emerging learning technologies and educational technologies in general and introducing college students on how they can utilize technology in their own instructional context. I consider myself a technology geek and I am passionate about immersive technology and how it can assist with people’s mental well-being as that is also one of my main research interests. I hope to gain more knowledge the next two years during my PhD to continue solidifying my career path that includes ELT. </p></div>

<b>My ELT Vision (After Class)</b></p></div>

<div><p>My ELT Vision has not changed drastically from the beginning of this course. However, I learned a lot about emerging learning technologies and the issues that I should be aware about. For example, the main question that stood out to me the most this semester was: Did you experience any emerging learning technologies (VR, MR, AR) in your classroom? That shifted my perspective on how accessibility can be an issue when it comes to implementing these advanced technologies in a higher education or a K-12 education setting. I recall having interesting conversations in class as a group on the reality of implementation of advanced learning technologies in classrooms due to lack of teacher training, school budget, administration procedures, etc. I did not dive in deeper into thinking about these issues before taking this class so it was definitely a huge eye opener for me.</p></div> 
<div><p>While completing the assignments for each technology (VR, AR, MR), I realized that I need a detailed instructional design plan before utilzing ELT in my teaching/training. For example, even though I recognize a really cool tool, there are many factors that I have to take into considerations before implementation. I learned that it is very important to figure out how I can use these technologies that will fit in my lesson plan or my instructional goals for my classroom. Starting from figuring the learner’s needs, learning materials, how the class is going to be facilitated while utilizing the technologies. I was once reminded again on how detail-oriented I have to be as an educator when it comes to using ELT in an educational setting. </p></div>
<div><p>In addition, it was interesting to see the instructional disadvantages of VR technology and the potential challenges instructors may have when it comes to integrating VR technology in their classes. In the beginning before taking this course, I realized that because it is an advanced technology, I assumed that there would be less issues when it comes to integrating the tool because of the sophisticated nature which may require less of a burden to keep the class engaged. However, there are other obstacles that needs attention on especially the technological capabilities and lack of instructor training resources of the technology itself.</p></div>
<div><p>As I mentioned in my previous vision statement, currently, I vision myself designing and developing products or software programs or projects using VR or other advanced learning technologies after I graduate with my doctoral degree. I would also like to continue teaching emerging learning technologies and educational technologies in general and introduce college students to how they can utilize technology in their own instructional context. For example, I was exposed to VR/AR development tools such as Unity and Mozilla Hubs and I would like to build a course on how instructors can use these tools to develop and design their own VR based learning environment. I think teaching instructors and other educators on how to use these technologies is the first step and I hope I can be a part of that ongoing movement. To emphasize again, I do consider myself a technology geek and I am passionate about immersive technology and specifically how it can assist with mental well-being as that is also one of my main research interests. I hope to gain more knowledge in the next two years during my Ph.D. to continue solidifying my career path that includes ELT with my specific research interests.</p></div>
