                Title: ALT-S 360 degree instructional video for students with autism Min Lee, Jennifer Moses, and Ray Opoku
              </h3>
			  <h4 class="center">Analysis</h4>
              <h4>
                Context
              </h4>
			  <p>Autistic participants have difficulty navigating to and from areas on campus (Schmidt et al., 2021). For this project, we will be creating a 360° video that is designed to help acclimate autistic participants to the VR Lab, the ALT Studio area, Norman Hall, and surrounding areas at UF from eye level.</p>

				Needs Assessment
			  </h4>
			  <p>According to Terlouw et al. (2020), they used a focus group to conduct a needs assessment. In our case, we will ask 5 autistic people a few open-ended questions regarding the use of 360-degree videos for educational or training purposes. The focus group questions will be self-developed and the aim of the questions will help identify design betters ideas for instructional content and also the users’ interests and motivations.</p>
			  <h4 class="center">Purpose and Instructional Goals</h4>
			  <h4>Significance and Rationale</h4>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide guidance on navigating to the research lab, allowing the user to be prepared for the trip. This project will allow users to safely navigate to the research lab located in the College of Education Institute for Advanced Learning Technologies (IALT) space. Using a 360° video created on location allows for the user to see exactly what they would see once they arrive at the space.</p>
			<h4>Instructional Objective(s)</h4>
			<p>1.  Given a video, the user will be able to navigate from the bus stop to the research lab, safely and efficiently.</p>
			<h4 class="center">Content</h4>
			<h4>
				Description
			  </h4>
			  <p>This VR learning unit contains an immersive experience where the user will learn how to
				navigate from the bus stop outside of Norman Hall, to the Research Lab located in the IALT space. Once immersed in the VR space, users will be able to see a 360° view of the environment. Final product will consist of video and still images to allow participants to pause and view detail of specific areas around Norman Hall.</p>
				<h4>Video Sequence:</h4>
				<p>➔ Start route</p>
				<p>➔ Starting from a bus stop near Norman Hall</p>
				<p>➔ Entrance of Norman Hall (where the big tree is)</p>
				<p>➔ Enter iALT space going downstairs</p>
				<p>➔ Turn right and enter the ALT-Studio lab space</p>
				<p>➔ End route</p>
				<h4 class="center">Instructional Strategies</h4>
				<h4>Delivery format</h4>
				<p>The immersive environment was made using a 360° GoPro camera. Photos and videos of the environment around the college of education were taken and a video was created. This video was then uploaded to YouTube. The user will have access to this content via a VR headset and through online content.</p>
				<h4>Teaching methods</h4>
				<p>There will be an instructional guide/voluntary guide on stand-by mode if the user needs assistance with accessing/using the 360-degree video. There will be verbal and written instructions (online or in-person) involved for the learners/users.</p>
				<h4 class="center">Assessment of Learning Outcomes</h4>
				<h4>Formative Evaluation</h4>
				<p>Instruction will be given through written instructions provided with the materials. The user can read the written instructions themselves or have another person (voluntary guide) assist with the instructions. The user will be on their own device, either a VR headset or a laptop/desktop-based computer. The user will be instructed that they can pause or stop the video at any time to ask questions or take breaks. During this immersive learning experience, students will be asked specific questions to describe what they are seeing through a think-aloud process. The voluntary guide will voice-record the learning experience session for research purposes only.</p>
				<h4>Summative Evaluation</h4>
				<p>A voluntary guide will observe the user/learner from the bus stop location to the research lab location. Below is a usability scenario that will work as an observation protocol for the voluntary guide that will assist the user for their real-time navigation.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><h4>Bus stop tour</h4><p>Brainstorm:
						User(s) have a look around the bus stop area and tell the voluntary guide what they think of their surrounding, just their general impression.</p></li>
					<li>
						<h4>Complete the on-campus navigation</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>While walking around with the user(s), the volunteer guide will address the following comments if needed:
								<ul>
									<li>After stopping by each location, the guide will provide an appraisal.
										<ul><li>Great job, (user’s name)!</li></ul>
									</li>
									<li>Take a look around and tell me what you make of this area.</li>
									<li>Tell me verbally when you are done with this location.</li>
									<li>What do you think about the written instructions?</li>
									<li>Did you fully understand what you were asked to do?</li>
									<li>Did you encounter any navigational difficulties?</li>
									<li>Which area is the hardest one to navigate?</li>
									<li>Do you think you used all the skills/knowledge you learned in the 360-degree
										VR video? (If not, which points did you miss?)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Upon completion of the navigation in the research lab.
								<ul>
									<li>What do you think about this real navigation session?</li>
									<li>What did you like? What did you not like about it?</li>
									<li>Any additional comments?</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Follow-up Research</h4>
				<p>After completing the 360-degree VR video, the user will be able to safely navigate to the research lab. Safe navigation assumes successful instructional design. In addition, users will be surveyed on their experience using the video and navigating to the location. A self-developed social validity survey instrument will be used that will ask about the user’s overall learning experience. This 5-point Likert-type scale survey will be in UF Qualtrics form. Below are the survey questions that will be asked:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>I liked the procedures used in this study.</li>
					<li>An experience like what I had today would be acceptable for other autistic people.</li>
					<li>In the future, I would be willing to use a 360-degree video like what I experienced
						today.</li>
					<li>Using the 360-degree video that I experienced today did not result in any negative
						side effects.</li>
					<li>The 360-degree video that I experienced today would be appropriate for other
						autistic people.</li>
					<li>I would encourage other autistic people to learn about this 360-degree video
						project.</li>
					<li>Overall, I believe this deliverable would be beneficial for autistic people.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Further research will be conducted on the impact this video has on the user's level of
					comfort during navigation. To collect useful data from the user, we will adapt the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ; Sauro & Lewis, 2016) to investigate user experience or usability issues of the 360-degree video.</p>
