                        This instruction unit is designed for one of the
                        9th-grade geography classes at a K-12 Elementary School
                        on the eastern coast of Mexico. The school’s location is
                        prone to heavy flooding during hurricanes and
                        earthquakes. In partnership with the county, 9th-grade
                        elementary students learn about the earth’s core,
                        explore the various layers and tectonic plates, and how
                        they cause earthquakes in their neighborhoods in an
                        experiential environment. The 9th-grade class has 14
                        students - 7 females and seven males, each with iPad
                        tablets. This class is diverse. 40.1% of this class
                        belongs to the upper class and 38.9 to the middle class,
                        and 21% to the lower class. 55.3% of students are
                        Hispanic/Latino, and 44.7% are people of color.

                      <h4>Needs Assessment</h4>

                      <h5>Expressive and Normative Needs</h5>
                      <p>
                        With each earthquake and tectonic shift event, teachers
                        and administrators at the elementary public school
                        observe students and their parents, citing and
                        attributing the occurrence to the wrath of a
                        supernatural being or an evil spirit. Given the
                        community's highly religious and superstitious nature,
                        such conclusions were not surprising. After a short
                        survey, over 80% of 9th graders and their parents
                        attributed earthquakes to the supernatural; as such,
                        teachers were tasked to teach students about the earth’s
                        formation and help clear up the misconception.
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Purpose and instructional goals</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h4>Significance and rationale for using MR</h4>
                      <p>
                        The purpose of this lesson unit is to introduce students
                        to introduce 9th graders to the earth’s core, its
                        layers, and how tectonic plates cause earthquakes. Using
                        MR technology allows students to manipulate, interact
                        and slice the virtual earth to reveal various layers.

                        At the end of the lesson, students will be able to:

                        <span class="bold">Introduction:</span> The lesson will
                        begin with the “Earth As An Onion” demonstration in MR.
                        Showing students the onion and asking them to identify
                        the vegetable. Students will answer questions about the
                        onion [size, taste, consistency]. I will pull the leaves
                        off the onion, showing how there are layers to the
                        onion, just like there are layers to the Earth.

                        with it. I will review and explain the layers and the

                        students. Have the students refer to their “Layers of
                        the Earth” diagram when each layer is introduced with
                        the HoloLens. I will allow for questions/student

                        The delivery format of this lesson will be face-to-face
                        in the classroom using Z-space Devices. Each student
                        will have a Z-space device accessible to them. A package
                        of Z-space pen, glasses, power chargers will be
                        included. There will be total of 3 people delivering the
                        course content (1 main instructor, 2 voluntary guides).

                      <p>
                        A combination of lectures (verbal and written
                        instructions), group activities, and experiential
                        learning will be used as teaching methods while using
                        the Z-space devices.

                  <h4>Assessment of learning outcomes</h4>
                  <p>
                    Students will be asked to engage in a five-minute free
                    writing activity about the earth’s core. What do they know,
                    what have they heard, what are they unsure about, and what
                    do they want to know? This writing activity aims to activate
                    prior knowledge, explore my students’ questions, and know
                    what they want to learn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After this activity, the students will work in groups to
                    write a collaborative summary in which they summarize their
                    key ideas.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <h4>Formative evaluation</h4>
                      <p>
                        After each part of the learning unit, each student will
                        verbally share/present what they need further
                        explanation for in addition to verbal check-ins
                        throughout the lesson. In addition, students will be
                        asked specific questions to describe what they are
                        seeing or thinking based on the MR content through a
                        think-aloud process. The two voluntary guides will be
                        taking notes for the main instructor as future reference
                        for course improvements.

                      <h4>Summative evaluation</h4>
                      <p>
                        At the end of the lesson, students will take a total of
                        15 item quiz based on every concept that is covered. The
                        quiz will be provided in a paper and pencil format and
                        each students will have a total of 45 minutes to
                        complete the quiz.

                  <h4>Follow-up Research</h4>
                  <p>
                    To evaluate the instructional impact of MR-based learning
                    and 3D modeling, we will conduct a qualitative research
                    using semi-structured interviews to gauge the participants’
                    knowledge level. The semi-structured interview questions
                    will be self-developed amongst the research team by
                    referring to academic resources as guidance (Pathak &
                    Intratat, 2012; Rabionet, 2011).
